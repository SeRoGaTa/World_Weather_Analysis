## Overview of Project
#### This project help travelers to find their best cities and therefore hotels regarding their preferences of weather. Here we ask the traveler which max and min temps they prefer and then we create a list of cities and hotels regarding those values and then offer them a map with all the data. In addition, we offer them also an itinerary based on some cities and how they need to drive from one city to the other one.

## Purpose
#### The purpose of this project is to facilitate travelers to choose wisely their destinations regarding on the weather they will see on each of the cities we offer, they can see wind speed, weather description, max temp, cloudiness, and humidity. With this data and the maps, we show them with pop ups data with hotels names and weather data they might choose some cities and create an itinerary to drive through them.

## Challenges
#### The biggest challenge I had with this project is to remember all the steps we need to filter dataframes, get data from API's, use keys, gitignore, save data to a file, get data from a file, use locations, and print maps. I think these is a very well complete script that has a little bit of everything.
